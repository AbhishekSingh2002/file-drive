🧪 Developer Notes
Toast logic inspired by react-hot-toast with support for variants and dismissal.

Tabs use @radix-ui/react-tabs and are fully stylable.

Uses class-variance-authority and tailwind-merge to control styles.

Only one toast shown at a time (TOAST_LIMIT = 1), customizable in use-toast.ts.
